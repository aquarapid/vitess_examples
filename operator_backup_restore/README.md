This example assumes you are using the PlanetScale proprietary operator,
although it can be adapted for the PlanetScale Operator for Vitess as
well.

This example assumes you have already used the operator getting started
guide and gotten a basic multi-zone configuration running in GCP, 
along with the necessary storageclass definitions.
This specific example uses the three GCP zones:
 * us-central1-a
 * us-central1-c
 * us-central1-f
